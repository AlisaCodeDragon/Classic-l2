It is not a bad idea to take your time and rest along the way when you are walking to another village. However, if you donâ€™t have the time, we gatekeepers can help you by opening the door of space  and time. Now, where do you want to go?<br>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="TELEPORT" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_teleport_list_1">Go to another village.</Button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="NORMAL" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_teleport_mdt_to" msg="811;Monster Race Track">Move to Arena & Monster Race Track (free)</Button>
<Button ALIGN=LEFT ICON="QUEST" action="bypass -h npc_%objectId%_Quest">Quest</Button>
