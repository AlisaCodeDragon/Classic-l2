Guard Gardner:<br>
In the past it was known as the Ghost Forest counterparts. Monsters dressed as people and attacked the defenseless victims... To be honest, I never saw the ghost of his double. They say that if you see him, you will die instantly...<br>
However, I am absolutely convinced that these monsters existed in the past. We know that if you hear someone coming for you in the woods, you can never look back, you have to run away with his eyes closed...<br>
Do not worry, there is no reason to believe that they still exist, but, on the other hand, reason to think that they have become extinct, and no ... I wonder where they could disappear? If so, who lives in the Forest of Mirrors?
