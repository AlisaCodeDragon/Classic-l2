Guard Paros:<br>
This waterfall falls from incredible heights. As I said, this is the most beautiful place on the continent! As if it created the angels themselves... But they say that behind the waterfall live terrible monsters.<br>
If you believe the rumors, they lured the victims into their lair, changing its appearance. Several years ago the Masters go in search of the missing in places inhabitant whole group, but only one returned back to the cleric. Very soon he died, saying before he died, only one word: "Zahak."<br>
I do not know what that means... Maybe he called the name of the beast? In any case, hearing this, Master's face changed. I do not know what it all means, but since then kept his mouth shut...<br>
