Guard Alvah:<br>
Once upon a time the Orc tribes lived in Gludio free life. When we humans have come here, we displace them. So far, they do not cause us to retaliation. But now they have a new governor, borax, and the situation has changed. They occupied the fertile land located in the north-west of Gludio, and organized a protest! In fact, their protest is justified, and I sympathize with them, but such actions can not be left unanswered. We have too many years cultivated the land...<br>
Under normal circumstances, we would draw the army, but, obviously, this situation is far from ordinary! Yet something must be done!
