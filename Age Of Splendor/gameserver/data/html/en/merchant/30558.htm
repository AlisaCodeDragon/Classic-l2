Trader Jakal:<br>
For the glory of the everlasting flame!! How are you, child of the flame?<br>
Are you looking for something in particular? If you need anything, tell me. There is nothing that Jakal can't find, for he is utterly committed to your satisfaction! You should be well prepared to venture out. When you're not prepared, you can easily fail! But, of course, there is no way our noble Orcs could ever be harmed by the wild animals out there. Ha ha ha!!<br>
