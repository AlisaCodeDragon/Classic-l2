Trader Uska:<br>
For the glory of the everlasting flame! How are you, child of the flame?<br>
I am Trader Uska! Nice to meet you, ha ha ha! I like getting to the point. I will ask you a short question. Is there anything you need? So, have a look around! Orcs should not waste time, even a few seconds! We should not neglect our training ... Keep this in mind!<br>
