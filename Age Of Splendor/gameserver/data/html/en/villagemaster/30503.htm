Warehouse Chief Rikadio:<br>
I am Warehouse Chief Rikadio of the Iron Gate Guild here in Gludio. The motto of the Iron Gate Guild is to 'sell anything anywhere in the world to anyone who needs it.' We are not hindered by snowy fields, deserts, or volcanic areas. We are a fine guild and go all over the world to increase the economic prosperity of the Dwarves. Ha ha ha, don’t you think we’re stunning? Well, have you come to me to become a member of our guild? Hmm… Let me see…<br>
