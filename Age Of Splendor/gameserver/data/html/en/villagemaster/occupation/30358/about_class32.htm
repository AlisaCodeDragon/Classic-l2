Tetrarch Thifiell:<br>
Your level must be at least 20 to be able to change to <font color="LEVEL">Palus Knight</font>, and you must complete the quest <font color="LEVEL">Test of the Palus Knight</font>.<br>
However, you cannot change profession here. This is because only those who have been known to human society and understand the world beyond the forest are qualified to change profession.<br>
For these reasons, you need to leave this forest, and to venture to the human kingdom of Aden. There is a guild built by the Dark Elves in the town of <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>, which is a land to the south of here. You must visit the <font color="LEVEL">Grand Masters</font>, who are the highest authorities of our members, and completing their searches will allow you to change profession.<br>
Also, there are two villas where you can go from the dark forest. One is the village of <font color="LEVEL">Gludin</font>. Although it is the same distance, you have more chances of sobrebivir if you take the road that goes to <font color="LEVEL">Scholl of Dark Arts</font> , and pass through the Neutral Zone towards the town of <font color="LEVEL">Gludio</font>. However, there can be many Elves in the Neutral Zone, can generate conflicts.<br>
