Warehouse Chief Reed:<br>
The fundamental characteristics of <font color="LEVEL">Scavangers</font> and Artisans are that the Scavanger collects rare materials and the Artisan makes something valuable from those materials. Therefore, a Scavanger must have above average physical strength and combat abilities. He is a great hunter who will brave any danger to collect valuable materials.<br>
The most talented Scavangers are selected to be <font color="LEVEL">Master Scavangers</font>. Master Scavangers go to the extreme to find arcane items like dragon scales.<br>
