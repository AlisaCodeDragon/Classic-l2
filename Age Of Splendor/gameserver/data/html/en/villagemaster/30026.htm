Grand Master Bitz:<br>
Greetings, I am Grand Master Bitz of the Fighters Guild here. I can give you information on how to change occupations, but you must go to the mainland in Aden to actually make the change. The reasoning behind this is that only those who have experienced the pleasures and dangers of other cultures and lands are prepared to take on the responsibilities of wielding new power that a higher level occupation offers.<br>
