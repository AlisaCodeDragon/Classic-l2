Neti:
<br>
I'm in the know. Show me the contract.
<br>
Is the seal of the Guild of the Iron Scales. Nearby
there is only one Dwarf of this Guild - <font color="LEVEL">Trader
Rolento</font>... But he couldn't sell the armor of the Orcs
Turek. So he's not...
<br>
There must be some misunderstanding! Either someone slandered
it... take it up with him, and all suspicion
disappear. Please! Rolento owns a shop in
<font color="LEVEL">the South Aisle of the Wasteland</font>. Be sure
meet with him.
