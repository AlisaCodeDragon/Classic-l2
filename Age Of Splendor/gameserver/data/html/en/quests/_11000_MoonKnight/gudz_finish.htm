Tetrarch Gnolls Gudz:
<br>
Oh, You brought 10 goals of the Invaders Orcs Turek! Wonderful!
<br>
But this is only the beginning! The Turek orcs will pay dearly for lying to us! Now my fearless warriors will be dressed in a new suit of armor and attacked a Camp of Orcs Turek!
<br>
And You go to Gludin village and give something to local residents. Tell them that great of Gnolls this time be generous and leave them alive! But someday we will crowstep Gludin village with the ground, so have them ready!
