The contract? Let's see... This is a contract to buy
large quantities of armor. Look at the print.
Without a doubt, this is the sign of the Guild Dwarves. Turns out
The dwarves supply military equipment Orcs
Turek?
<br>
Hmm... Need to figure out what the Guild Dwarves
entered into an Alliance with the Orcs Turek. For this
you need to verify which Guild
has a mark on print in the contract, but
ask directly at the Dwarves not...
<br>
By the way! You know <font color="LEVEL">Neti</font> who lives here?
You need to ask her! They say that in his youth
Neti lived in the vicinity of Aden. So she
knows the society of the Dwarves.
