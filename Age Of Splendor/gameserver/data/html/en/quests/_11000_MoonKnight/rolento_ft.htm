Dealer Rolento:
<br>
You are right. I sostavyat contract. Did something happen?
<br>
What do You say? I sold gnolam gear? No, no, no! It wasn't like that!
<br>
Now I'll tell You everything. Recently I was visited by a Commander of Orcs and Turek said they signed a peace Treaty with Gnolam. In a sign of good faith he wanted to make a gift to their tribe, and therefore ordered my armor. That's all!
