Blacksmith Rupio:<br>
So nice to see you, young traveler. I am Rupio, dispatched from the Black Anvil.<br>
My brother Pushkin and I wish to make the best forge in Giran. We couldn't work for a while because our tools hadn't yet arrived from the Dwarven Village in the north. Finally they're here and we can begin our work.<br>
