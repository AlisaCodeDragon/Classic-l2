Hello... Good day!<br>
Oh, you want to draw a symbol?<br1>
Hmm... Even the paint brought good?<br>
However, this is not such a simple thing!<br>
So, what do you think? You need to know exactly what you want, because the pleasure is not cheap!<br>
Choose the right symbol - it's like to select a good sword and shield!!! Ha ha!<br>
