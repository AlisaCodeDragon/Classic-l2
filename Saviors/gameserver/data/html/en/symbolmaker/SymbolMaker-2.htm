Want to learn about occupations? Ah, so many jobs, too lazy to tell...<br>
Well! Nothing can be done. This is my job...<br>
I recall that increases symbol one of physical characteristics, but also reduces one of the two other physical characteristics. Same thing with the mental characteristics.<br>
Changes in the physical characteristics available for all professions.<br>
However, changes in Intellect, Spirit and Wisdom - is another matter.<br>
For them, there are restrictions on trade.<br>
I'll explain everything. Listen carefully!<br>
Only the battle mages can increase Spirit by Intelligence or Wisdom and intelligence increase by the Spirit.<br>
Increase Wisdom by intelligence and vice versa can be all but healers.<br>
Finally, all the wizards may increase due to the Spirit of Wisdom.<br>
You understand? If not, then nothing can be done. Ask your friends.<br>
