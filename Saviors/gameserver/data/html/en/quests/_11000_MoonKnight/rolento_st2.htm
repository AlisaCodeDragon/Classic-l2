Dealer Rolento:
<br>
I was told that the armor needed for hunting! Said Gnolam facing hunger in the winter, so they need armor, or while hunting for hogs they may suffer! So actually they wanted to use the armor for the attacks are the city? I swear I knew nothing! Trust me!
<br>
(Crying.)And I wanted to celebrate the conclusion of such a good contract!
<br>
Out, vile Orcs were going to attack Gludin village with Gholami... I will not stand for it! I have a great idea to ruin their plans!
