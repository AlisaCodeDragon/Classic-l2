Moon Knight Johnson:
<br>
What?! Have you seen the Turek Orcs in an Abandoned
Camp? So... These things came together and
getting ready to attack us together. This is a disaster!
<br>
...But it seems to me that it is better not to hurry with
report to Sir Maspero. First nuzhneo collect
reliable information. Kill <font color="LEVEL">commander of the Orcs
Turek</font> in the vicinity of the Camp of the Orcs and search for him
body to find any information about them
plans. Very little time! I ask You to hurry.
