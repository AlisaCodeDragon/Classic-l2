Trader Damion:
<br>
You sent the guards? You are a mercenary? Hmm...
<br>
Okay, to business. There has recently been bad
history. Of gnolls robbed the caravan, which was in
Gludio, and among other things stole <font color="LEVEL">10 Blanks</font> 
create armor. These materials went to the merchant
Amor. Saying she appreciates the accuracy and
newcastlee execution of all items
the contract...If she does not receive the goods on time,
can break all trade relations with our
city. But if other traders know, 
unable to follow her example. It will bring
a huge loss...
<br>
Please! <font color="LEVEL">Locate the stolen cargo and Gholami
give it amore</font>. It can be found to the West of
Lake Palmer.
<br>
By the way,before You go,I can tell You 
something interesting. Recently it dawned on me
