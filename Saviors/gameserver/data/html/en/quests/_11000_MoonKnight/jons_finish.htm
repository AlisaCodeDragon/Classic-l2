Moon Knight Johnson:

Great job. Thanks to You, managed to thwart the plan of enemy attack. Moreover, now the Turek Orcs and the Gnolls became enemies. I even dream of such could not. And it's all thanks to You. They say that sometimes one man can do more than an army... Apparently this is said about You.
<br>
You will get a decent reward. This is the decision of the Guardians, Gludio. This award - thanks for all Your efforts.
<br>
You can choose between <font color="LEVEL">Armor.</font> Only one, so be careful.
