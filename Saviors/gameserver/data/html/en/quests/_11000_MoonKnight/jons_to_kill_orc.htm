Moon Knight Johnson:
<br>
I just received a letter from Damiona. It
asked to convey to You that all the products
stole of Gnolls, managed to return and get
to the customer. Damion is very grateful to You. You
did a good job.
<br>
But... There's a new problem. Scouts report
the Turek Orcs have begun to actively prepare for
the attack on Gludin village. I reported to Sir Klaus
Vespero, but he only ordered to watch them.
Sir Klaus believes that the Orcs are too few and they
not dare to attack. Hmm...
