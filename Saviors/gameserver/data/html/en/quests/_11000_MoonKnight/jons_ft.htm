Moon Knight Johnson:
<br>
You have no idea how much trouble from the Gnolls in
the last time. Just a couple of days ago, they
attacked the convoy, which was heading to 
Gludio, and escaped with rich booty. After that
merchants of Aden was sent to the guards, Gludio
request for help...
<br>
But the guards, as You know, I can't
to allocate soldiers to guard because of the different
the rascals who are waiting for the right moment to
the attack on the city. Traders discussed
this question, but nothing I can think of.
In the end, in order to <font color="LEVEL">to deal with Gnolam</font>
decided to invite mercenaries. It's a pity that 
such an important matter have to charge
outsiders...
<br>
What? You are also a mercenary?... Ha ha! Good thing
You was found. What do you say? You have
a good chance to help us bring peace and
the well-being of Gludin village. Well, I agree?
