Tetrarch Kaitar:<br>
The holy darkness to protect this land.<br>
I am Tetrarch Kaitar, prophet of the dark chosen by the <font color="LEVEL">Great Kain</font>, father of darkness. I serve <font color="LEVEL">Shilen</font>, the mother of the abyss, and priest black that interprets the will of Shilen.<br>
Goddess of death and fate, Shilen sometimes gives me the ability to see the future. For many generations my family has been born with the ability to predict the future by casting the bones of the dead and observing their ways, or staring at the eyes of the dead. In the current situation, with enemies rodeandonos, it is my task to foresee the disasters that may threaten the future of our race.<br>
