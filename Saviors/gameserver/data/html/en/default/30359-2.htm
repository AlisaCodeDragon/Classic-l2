Tetrarch Kaitar:<br>
Shilen, the Mother of the Abyss, it is the Goddess that controls the hatred and death. Shilen allows you to limit the life, and it is she who controls the death, to which all living beings to be able to return to their pure states. Other races do not understand the cycle of the eternal birth and death. They see only one side of death, and fear and hate to Shilen.<br>
Due to these prejudices, in the Human Kingdom, the brand name of Shilen hanging from the neck is enough reason to die burned at a stake. Despite this persecution, there are sensitive groups of Humans who follow the Goddess Shilen. In a sense, his faith is equal to that of the Dark Elves. If only we could know who they are.<br>
