Captain Lucas:<br>
Come, come, my young friend. I welcome you to Dion. I am Lucas, in charge of the guards here. Is this your first trip to Dion? I don't know what your business here is, but our village is very quiet and peaceful. I must ask you to behave modestly and cause no unwarranted incidents while you are here.<br>
Also, it is very dangerous outside the village. If possible, I advise that you travel with others in a group. Good luck, then!<br>
