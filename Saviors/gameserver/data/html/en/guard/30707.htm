Captain Raigen:<br>
Welcome! Glad to see you! I Raigen, the captain of the Hunters Village. Our settlement was founded by hunters, who came here in search of rare animals that are found in the Enchanted Valley and the Forest of Mirrors. Even Lord Aden respects the special way of life of the village and to a certain extent it recognizes the government.<br>
However, as in any place where people gather rough, there will never be a carefree life. Even if many things a blind eye, so in any case we can not ignore the existence of the Guild of Outlaws. On these walks a lot of rumors, but I can not catch them... If you suddenly meet someone suspicious, be sure to tell me.<br>
