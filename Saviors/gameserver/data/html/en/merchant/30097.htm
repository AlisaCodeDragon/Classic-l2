Trader Galladucci:<br>
Our high-end shop has opened again and there are many precious weapons. I hope you find something you like.<br>
I'm sorry but we don't accept adena anymore, only <font color="LEVEL">crystals.</font> I hope that's not too inconvenient.<br>
If you're looking for armor, just ask my wife next to me.<br>
