Trader Reep:<br>
Hello! I am Reep, the manager of the first Golden Wheel shop. I am always at your service.<br>
When it comes to items, high price doesn't guarantee good quality, even though you shouldn't look for whatever's cheap. Correlation of price and quality? Of course, it's important. But the most important thing is the critical eye, to find appropriate items for different applications.<br>
I am sure your critical eye will value these displayed items.<br>
