Trader Hally:<br>
Whew... Welcome! Tired? Go rest there. What brings you here? Ah, you don't need to say. Yes, of course I know... What kind of people would come to the Hunters' Village? People who want to hunt... Am I right? Right?<br>
This village is a village for various kinds of Hunters. Ahhh, don't just stand there, come on over and check out the items. I probably look like someone who just talk rubbish all day to his customers without doing any business...!<br>
