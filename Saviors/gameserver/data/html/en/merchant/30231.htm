Trader Garette:<br>
Hey, young fellow, you look great! Did you have a good adventure? Or are you looking for one from now on? We must toast to your fortune, right? And, if you are looking for something good you have come to the right place. Right now I am selling my items dirt cheap.<br>
Now is the time for you to buy heaps of items you desire. You become lucky if your pack is full! There is no tomorrow for a stingy adventurer...<br>
