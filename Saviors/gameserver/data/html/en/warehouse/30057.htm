Warehouse Freightman Aldo:<br>
It looks like you’re about to head out on a journey. You’re not actually going to take all that stuff with you, are you? Listen, let me give you a piece of advice... Take only what is absolutely necessary. The rest you can leave with me, Aldo. The Iron Gate is the best warehouse around. You can rest easy knowing your valuables are safe and sound.<br>
