Grand Master Tobias:<br>
The <font color="LEVEL">Assassins</font> are assassins who kill quietly and quickly, disappearing in the shadows. They are also spies and warriors of the night; they are equipped with skills of ocultacion and concealment. Your white are the weak points of the enemies, fast with daggers, or shooting arrows at a great distance. While the <font color="LEVEL">Palus Knights</font> are going to the front on the field of battle, the <font color="LEVEL">Assassins</font> of the race of the darkness of the moonless night, call for the victory silently.<br>
The best Assassins are sometimes chosen as <font color="LEVEL">Abyss Walkers</font> to learn the latest secrets to kill and explore. On the other hand, some Assassins are chosen as <font color="LEVEL">Phantom Rangers</font>, and are trained with skills of archery to a higher level.<br>
To be an Assassin, you have to pass the challenge and bring me back the <font color="LEVEL">iron heart</font>.<br>
