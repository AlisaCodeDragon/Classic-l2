High Prefect Osborn:<br>
Basically, to become a Orc Monk, your level must be at least 20 and you must pass the Test of the Orc Monk.<br>
To take the Test of the Orc Monk, seek the Orc named <font color="LEVEL">Gantaki Zu Urutu of the Orc village</font>. He will tell you everything you need to know. After you pass the test, come to me and I will change your profession. Use the Gatekeeper to go to the Orc village.<br>
